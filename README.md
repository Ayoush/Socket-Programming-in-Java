# Socket-Programming-in-Java
Socket Programming in Java is quite Fun and Easy(as long as you are enjoying what you are doing).
I had implemented TCP/IP Sockets, Datagram Sockets in which I had implemented UDP and Multicasting.
Then I had implemented RMI which takes a lot of time but it's fun to learn.
I had triend my best to make it as simple as possible.
